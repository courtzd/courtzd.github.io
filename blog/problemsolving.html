    </header>

    <p>
      Everyone has had those times in their lives, where they're up against
      challenges and problems. Me personally, i've decided to go full send, and
      do this deving thing. At times i think this is a clear example of my
      insanity, because everything seems like a struggle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learning new skills, in particular coding can prove frustrating. Even the
      simplest of problems can prove the most taxing. And all through this
      sprint in particular, i have foundmyself faced with challenges. What i
      perceive to be relatively straight forward, makes me scratch my head
      longer than i care to admit. But its also been a good lesson on
      determination, perservance and problem solving.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first obstance I had, was with the FizzBuzz problem. It seemed simple
      enough write a function to returns "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for
      multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" where the number was divisible by both 3
      and 5.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had to use several problem solving techniques, the one i utilised the
      most was "Rubber Ducky" in this case i talked out loud to my trusty peace
      lily. Things seem to make more sense when i say it out loud than when i
      repeat it over in my head. I also utilised, console.logging to debug my
      errors, and i found Pseudocoding to be really good as well. Though i find
      i prefer to write my pseudocode manually on a peice of paper than in to
      the terminal itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm still not good at asking for help, i really need to work on this. I've
      always been a self directed learner. I try and use google assistance, to
      deconstruct my code to define where my errors might be in it, rather than
      using it for the answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      How confident do i feel? A little bit more every day. It comes in waves,
      there are glory moments and then face palm moments. But it all comes back
      to perservance.
