    <h3>
      <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</strong></br></h3>

    
    <p>
      <strong>Self Awareness</strong> - <br>the past few weeks have definitely given me a deeper understanding of what i am capable of and what my limitations are. I've really become aware of when i fixate on things that aren't important, no just in my study life but also in my home life. I am finding and developing strategies to stay focused on what is needed to be done and is important. Rather than going down rabbit holes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Adaptability<strong> - <br>I've really had to adapt my approach to things, you can have all the best plans in the world. But somewhere something will come unstuck, and I've really had to adapt to things popping up, and navigating the changes more effectively. Which also leads back to my self awareness. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Self Motivation - Keeping motivated! I've had plenty of things come up, and it ties in with my adaptability. There are things i find difficult to understand and could just give up on, but i am motivated to keep focused and committed. And part of that is also being honest with myself as much as possible when hurdles appear. 
    </p>

    <p> All in all, i've really had to do a lot of self reflection over these past few weeks! It has been truly eye opening, and the challenges have been there. </p>


    <h3>
      <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong></br></h3>

    
    <p>
      All of these qualities work hand in hand. They are integral to learning as they can guide and support you in your own decision making. They influence what you work on and how you work, as well as how you work with others. In my opinion, programming and learning are forever continuous. You will never know absolutely everything in programming, and should always be in a constant state of learning and expanding your own knowledge. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Being empathetic isn't just about relating to people and knowing how to work together, its also crucial for understand the needs of other users and developing software that is user friendly. 
    </p>
   
    <p>
      Being self aware in programming and learning, is also very important. When you are self aware you can target things better, you know what your strengths are and your limitations. It can really help with focus and overall and improve problem-solving that will lead to more favourable solutions.  
    </p>
   

    <h3>
      <strong>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</strong></br></h3>

      <p>
      That it was actually a thing for programming. It wasn't until i started to do the human skills models that i realised how important human skills are for working in this industry. I had always just envisioned that people worked solo more than anything, but now i have come to realise that this isn't the case. And being able to develop ones own human skills is so very important. Key skills like active listening, building repertoire with others, are crucial. Even, know your own identity and values is important. 
    </p>
   

    <h3>
      <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</strong></br></h3>

      <p>
      Actually realising the value of human skills, at the beginning, i thought it was non-sense. But I can definitely say now, i am way more aware of myself. 
    </p>
   
    <h3>
      <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong></br></h3>

      <p>
      Because anyone can code. Coding in itself is just a skill as it's just learning a language. But to me the reason i think human skills are so important is because you are actually working with other human beings, who have different life experiences, knowledge, values. And its important to be able to build relationships with people. Because you will be working with people. Regardless of if thats in an office or remotely. Coding is done by people. 
    </p>

    <h3>
      <strong>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></br></h3>

      <p>
      At the beginning i thought it was going to be a waste of time, but as i progressed through the modules it became clear why human skills is important. </p>
      
      <p>Getting to know my homegroup is a classic example of why human skills is important. Learning things about active listening and looping. Was a really interesting exercise, and i could see the real work application of it for the future. 
    </p>

    <p>Even writing a learning plan, i thought was an interesting exercise as it shows what i thought at the beginning with my learning journey, to how i am now. Some things have changed. 
    </p>

    <p>So yes, I am now pro Human skills learning. Because I think its important to understanding yourself and others.
