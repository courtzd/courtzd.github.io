<h3>What is neuroplasticity and growth mindset? </h3>
    
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity, is the brains ability to change and adapt in response to what is experiencing and learning. It the creation of new neuron pathwyays in the brain or reoganising and solidifying existing ones. It is a life long process and defies the saying "Can't teach an old dog new tricks". Because the brain is more than capable of this, and we see it when individuals are affected by injury or disease where the brain reprogrammes itself to compensate or enhance existing cognivitie abilities. </p>

    <p>As complicated as it may sound, rewiring the brain to learn something new is quite achievable for everyone. Stimulating the brain and overcoming challenges, me personally I am experiencing this now, with the Dev Academy programme, there are lots of things to learn, and though it can be an overwhelming struggle sometimeds, it is all slowly starting to make much more sense as I continue to challenge my brain to learn all these concepts. </p>

    <p>Which leads into the growth mindset, to me growth mindset is how i view challenges and what i learn from setbacks. I'm a naturally "half full" kind of person, and have always been into positive mindsets. A good growth mindset can provide a good platofrm for resilince and help to maintain motivation. </p>

    <p>I liken to the saying "like begets, like". So if we foster and promote good and positive behaviours, they just become natural parts of us.</p>

    <p>As part of my learning,I do have to remind myself that i am just that a learner, and all these feelings that i experience are just normal and with continued pursuit I will master and understand more and more of what I am learning.</p>
