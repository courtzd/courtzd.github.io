    <h3> Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>

    <p>
      Choosing to quit my job, because the policies did not align with my personal values. This was a very personal ethical decision i had to make for myself. It took me months. The biggest fear was financial instablity. But i knew if i remained I would not have done my job to the best of my ability which is equally unfair to my colleagues. Do i regret quitting. No. I feel happier and am now doing things that interest me. I feel far more fulfilled and still back my decision, regardless of the financial impact. 
    </p>

    <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <p>
     I grew up with my grandparents, and surrounded by my iwi and hapu. I am very much a marae kid. I believe in the village mentality as this is what i was exposed and now expose my children too. My M훮oritanga is core to my identity.

    <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
    <p>
     Adaptablity - I find it easy to adapt to different learning environments, and people
    <br>
    Detail Orientated - I've always paid attention to details 
    <br>
    I am a very visual person, I can remember details quite well from just watching examples. 
    </p>

    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
    <p>I've committed myself from the beginning of this programme, to ask for help sooner rather than later. Though there are huge amounts of resources available online, I know my greatest resrouce can and will be my peers. To much self seeking information can affect my time management and productivity. 
<br><br>
      If the workload becomes overwhelming, i will break it down into more managable steps and step away for a regular breaks. 
    <br><br>  
      I'll manage my time by sticking to my schedule, setting myself daily with goals at hand and time frames.</p>

      <h3> Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
<p>
There will be concepts that take me a longer to understand, I know that. This is truly going to be the "dog learning new tricks" kind of scenario i feel for myself anyway. But all limitations come with growth opportunity and i accept those challenges. 

</p>
<h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>

<p> I spent a majority of my professional career in public service, there was always resistance. Especially around the training of cultural competencies in alignment with the Organisations M훮ori policy. The best strategy is to find allies within the group. Someone who can help champion the things we were trying to teach. Its also about addressing ignorances and challenging them. If i was to do it all over again, I'd get the participants to share their experiences to guage the kind of background/upbringing. This seems to give a better understanding of individuals. Even understanding the demographic of the group prior to undertaking the training. No 2 offices are the same.  </p>
