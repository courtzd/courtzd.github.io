      I really want to learn how to work more collobratively with people, I know this industry is huge on collobration. Even with my professional background, we worked "with" people but that was more of a lead over a team scenario than active collobration that this industry has.

    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
    <p>I've committed myself from the beginning of this programme, to ask for help sooner rather than later. Though there are huge amounts of resources available online, I know my greatest resrouce can and will be my peers. To much self seeking information can affect my time management and productivity. 
<br><br>
      If the workload becomes overwhelming, i will break it down into more managable steps and step away for a regular breaks. 
    <br><br>  
      I'll manage my time by sticking to my schedule, setting myself daily with goals at hand and time frames.</p>

      <h3> Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>

<h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
