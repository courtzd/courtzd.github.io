<h2> Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

<h3> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

  <p>
   My long term goal is to continue learning and growing in coding arena. Again i still don't have a definitive career plan, as I am doing this programme more as a self interest personal development. Proving to myself that I can learn new things and the challenges that come with it.

   So even though i don't have a specific destination in mind, it doesn't mean something along the way won't pop up and i follow that pathway. 
  </p>


  <h3> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>

    <p>
     Foundations allowed me to work through my perfectionism and just get things done, it was hard but i definitely know i let go in some parts to ensure i met time targets. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I dont think the limitations I noted down in foundations will change, they still limit me, i have just gotten a little bit better at managing them.  
     </p>

     <p>
      Breaking my foot and injuring myself at the beginning of bootcamp, has definitely set me back. Mentally and physically. But i am proud of the fact that i said something to my facilators. I'm still here to succed even if the plan has to be adjust slightly, which it has as i have moved to part time.   
     </p>

     <h3> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>

     <p>
       Staying focussed will definitely be a big one. I had full time boot camp all kind of panned out in my head and had plans in place for support. So changing to part time i'm going to have to re-evaluate my plan and continue to push. 
     </p>

     <h3> What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

     <p>
       Definitely working in teams,  pair-programming with others. I'd like to see me grow in this area, because it would help me deal with not being always in control. I'm using to managing other people more than working alongside them. So i am looking forward to seeing how i grow in this area the most, it both excites me and terrifies me. 
     </p>

     <h3> What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>

     <p>
       Same as foundations, that the support is there when needed. That they are approachable, and open. 
     </p>

     <h3> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>

     <p>
       As cliche as it sounds, but i expect myself to always strive to do my best at all times. Be committed, be present and be involved.
     </p>
     <p><li>
      Being present - is attending any required classes or meetings
      Being involved - is having the willingness to contribute to discussions, group work and getting my work done.
      Being committed - Is about being honest with myself and others, if im struggling then I need to say something sooner rather than later. </li>
    </p>
 

    <h3> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

    <p>
      Career wise I don't have a long term goal, im currently at a stage in my life where i'm doing things that i've wanted to do and challenge me. If i find a suitable employment outcome from this then thats just a bonus. But im driven more by the challenge than the goal itself. 
      Im on a quest to fulfilment. 
    </p>

    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p>
      <Strong> Limitations</Strong><br><br>
      I can fixate on irrelevant details for far to long and can often find myself going down an unnecessary rabbithole. 
      Alongside the fixations i tend to have, i can often be a perfectionist. As the saying goes. Perfectionism is the enemy of progress and i know this to be very true for myself.
      Difficulty in seeking help: I do find this challenging as I am a self motivated person who will seek answers in my own way. 
    <br>
    <br>
      <strong>Strengths;</strong><br><br>
      Willingness to accept feedback, i'm not easily offended by criticism or feedback as I see it all as part of my learning journey. 
      Problem solving: I enjoy problem solving, I am a very logical and deep thinker when it comes to problems. I've always excelled in this area in my professional life. 
      Persistent : I will perserver in most challenges, even if it frustrates me to death. I like to meet challenges and achieve goals. 
    </p>

    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      I really want to learn how to work more collobratively with people, I know this industry is huge on collobration. Even with my professional background, we worked "with" people but that was more of a lead over a team scenario than active collobration that this industry has. 
    </p>

    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
    <p>I've committed myself from the beginning of this programme, to ask for help sooner rather than later. Though there are huge amounts of resources available online, I know my greatest resrouce can and will be my peers. To much self seeking information can affect my time management and productivity. 
<br><br>
      If the workload becomes overwhelming, i will break it down into more managable steps and step away for a regular breaks. 
    <br><br>  
      I'll manage my time by sticking to my schedule, setting myself daily with goals at hand and time frames.</p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>

<p>For them to be approachable and just help out without giving all the answers. They're there to support me on my journey not do the work for me.
</p>

<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
<p>I have established a good whanau support network to support me over these coming weeks. They will help me with any of my whanau committments and I have cleared my schedule over the coming weeks to focus on this programme. </p>
