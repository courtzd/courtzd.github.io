    <h3> What the heck is JavaScript, HTML, and CSS?</h1>

    <p>
      HTML is the structure of a webpage, like the frame and foundations of building a house. It defines what goes where and how the basics are laid out.
CSS is the interior designer that comes in, it decides how everything will look, the colours, the styles of the decor everything that gives a home, its unique look.
JavaScript, is the techcnology you put into your house, the appliances, the wiring, how things work together. One master panel keeping your home wired and functional.
    </p>

    <h3>What the DOM are you on about?</h3>
    <p>
     
      Now we know that the Javascript, HTML and CSS are like building a house, DOM is like the blueprint. It helps JavaScript work with and talk with HTML & CSS that make up web pages.
If you wanted to change just one rooms interior colour of your house, you would use the dom to find the right room and then instruct it to paint it. 
JavaScript also has this ability to find and identify specific elements and change their contents. 

    <h3>Well then whats these control flow, loop things I keep seeing?</h3>
    <p>
      If you've ever been to subway and had a sub made, you know all to well that there is a process with which you get your sub made. You pick your bread, the fillings and then it meets you at the end. Control flow, is that recipe. The step by step guide on how to do something. Loops are like having multiple subway sandwhich makers, repeating the process until all the subs are made.
    </p>

    <h3>What are arrays and object things then?. </h3>
    <p>Seeing as we've been talking about Subway, Arrays are a collection. Like  shopping list of the ingredients. Where every ingredient is given a corresponding number when it's on the list. If we need to find or change the list, we know where it is based on its position.

      Objects are like the aisles of the supermarket, where every section has the items labelled. When you are familiar with your local supermarket, you know exactly where things are without having to follow a specific path. 

<h3>So what do functions do and what are they?</h3>

<p>Functions again are intructions that can be reused whenever you need to reuse them.
