      <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence</h1>

      <strong>Ko te manu e kai ana i te miro, nōna te ngahere. Ko te manu e kai ana i te mātauranga, nōna te ao</strong></br>

    <h3> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>

    <p>
      Career wise I don't have a long term goal, im currently at a stage in my life where i'm doing things that i've wanted to do and challenge me. If i find a suitable employment outcome from this then thats just a bonus. But im driven more by the challenge than the goal itself. 
      Im on a quest to fulfilment.

    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p>
      <Strong> Limitations</Strong><br><br>
      I can fixate on irrelevant details for far to long and can often find myself going down an unnecessary rabbithole. 
      Alongside the fixations i tend to have, i can often be a perfectionist. As the saying goes. Perfectionism is the enemy of progress and i know this to be very true for myself.
      Difficulty in seeking help: I do find this challenging as I am a self motivated person who will seek answers in my own way. 
    <br>
    <br>
      <strong>Strengths;</strong><br><br>
      Willingness to accept feedback, i'm not easily offended by criticism or feedback as I see it all as part of my learning journey. 
      Problem solving: I enjoy problem solving, I am a very logical and deep thinker when it comes to problems. I've always excelled in this area in my professional life. 
      Persistent : I will perserver in most challenges, even if it frustrates me to death. I like to meet challenges and achieve goals.

    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      I really want to learn how to work more collobratively with people, I know this industry is huge on collobration. Even with my professional background, we worked "with" people but that was more of a lead over a team scenario than active collobration that this industry has. 
    </p>

    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
    <p>I've committed myself from the beginning of this programme, to ask for help sooner rather than later. Though there are huge amounts of resources available online, I know my greatest resrouce can and will be my peers. To much self seeking information can affect my time management and productivity. 
<br><br>
      If the workload becomes overwhelming, i will break it down into more managable steps and step away for a regular breaks. 
    <br><br>  
      I'll manage my time by sticking to my schedule, setting myself daily with goals at hand and time frames.</p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>

<p>For them to be approachable and just help out without giving all the answers. They're there to support me on my journey not do the work for me.
</p>

<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
<p>I have established a good whanau support network to support me over these coming weeks. They will help me with any of my whanau committments and I have cleared my schedule over the coming weeks to focus on this programme. </p>
